Today is last day of Snake's Year. It's time to review what has been done, what has been left.

1. Learnt new language, ie. Objective-C, and worked with it for a year.
1. Released some versions of two apps on AppStore.
1. One major project is still not in good form, which means, it is moved to new year.
1. PM is still far from real.

Year of Hourse is coming and there are some works to do. Let's rock and roll.
