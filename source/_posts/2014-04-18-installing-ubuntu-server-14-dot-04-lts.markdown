There is nothing fancy by installing new OS. It's dead simple to install Ubuntu server for learning purpose.

1. First, go to [here](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) to download ubuntu-14.04-server-amd64.iso file.
2. Second, mount iso file to Virtual Box/Parallel Desktop and install OS from there.
3. Third, wait and see.
